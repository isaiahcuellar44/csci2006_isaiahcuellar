/* Right now I am still a little confused on server side programming, but at the end of this course i hope to get a basic understanding of how the server side programming works
and with that knowledge (along with client side programming) I hope to create a website for my younger sister and her hair salon business and continue from there! I hope to get an internship (as this is my last semester at Century College before transferring to Metro State) in the web devlopment realm and get some more experience for my future endeavors. */
